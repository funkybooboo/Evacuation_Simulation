Objective of the Code

Our project aims to facilitate simulations of evacuations in the event of a fire outbreak. Evacuation accidents pose a perpetual threat to society, and providing designers with the ability to finely adjust simulation parameters to anticipate outcomes in emergency scenarios is crucial. Preventing injury or even death would be the goal of designers. Our code aims to give them a tool to predict what would happen given their parameters. Our simulation allows users to observe how various types of individuals react in diverse situations. The research paper that we based our simulation off of focuses on preventing stampedes in emergencies, we've expanded the concept by introducing more complex behaviors among the agents in the simulation. Some complex behaviors added include: being able to ask for help finding an exit or stair, fighting with game theory rules, being able to jump out of windows if the agent deems it necessary, and so much more. These behaviors are used to enhance the simulation's effectiveness in measuring a likely outcome. The program measures numerous factors and gauges how well the evacuation went. Metrics recorded include: the number of people, fire speed, individual attributes, behavioral tendencies, and more. So much data is recorded in fact that it would be impractical for a human to go through all the necessary data to see how things went. Data analysis tools could be used to comb through the data and determine what happened during the evacuation simulation. Our recorded data is broken up into relevant files. Making it easy to find the information you are looking for. Our simulation could be expanded to include more choices for agents, more data recorded, and other ideas as requested by the Designer. We are confident that our project could be expanded to be a real asset to society. Allowing Designers to see what would happen in the worst case scenario in their building before it's even built. 

Description of the Simulation

The simulation operates on a 3D grid representing a building that is populated with individuals. The building consists of multiple floors, each containing numerous rooms and hallways. Individuals vary in their familiarity with the building and adherence to evacuation plans. A fire initiates randomly on the map and progressively spreads over time. Individuals assess their surroundings and make decisions on evacuation routes. They utilize environmental memory for decision-making. We followed the see-think-act model for agents. In unfamiliar surroundings, they can explore to find stairs or exits. Conflict avoidance and physical confrontation are modeled behaviors determined by an agent's ability to get to an exit without hitting other agents first. If unable to get to the desired location, and they want to fight, they can compete with an agent over a location. Individuals trapped in rooms with fires attempt to escape via doors or windows, stronger individuals are capable of breaking windows or even attempting to pass through fires at a great cost of health. Fear and health status influence decision-making, with frightened individuals exhibiting more irrational behaviors. The simulation continues until all individuals exit the building, die, or the firefighters arrive.
We allow agents to make decisions in a number of ways as selected by the operator of the simulation: All agents choose randomly, by ChatGPT, by logical statements, or by the operator making the choice for the agent themselves! This is exciting because there is not just one way that your simulation could turn out given the same starting parameters, agents will make different decisions depending on what choice mode you have selected. This gives the operator the ability to ruffly choose how they think agents should react. 

Expanding the Simulation

Introducing other emergency scenarios such as earthquakes, floods, or terrorist attacks.
Modeling familial relationships among individuals to simulate group dynamics and decision-making processes.
Incorporating disabilities among individuals to account for different mobility levels and evacuation challenges.
Allowing individuals to carry objects such as personal belongings, pets, or emergency supplies, affecting their mobility and decision-making.
Enhancing interpersonal relationships among individuals to simulate cooperation, leadership, or conflicts during evacuations.
Fine-tuning individual attributes such as strengths, weaknesses, health conditions, and fears to create more nuanced behaviors and responses.
Enriching environmental details with additional objects, diverse terrain types, and weather effects to simulate realistic evacuation scenarios.
Implementing dynamic environmental changes, such as complex fire spread patterns, and extinguishing efforts by individuals or emergency responders.
Facilitating information sharing among individuals about the environment, emergency procedures, and safe evacuation routes to promote collaboration and collective decision-making.
Exit knowledge based on the path of entry to a current location; people should know the path they took to get in and be able to use it to get out.
There are many more, but I don't want to bore you!

Significance of the Output

The simulation output serves as a valuable resource for understanding the impact of various factors on evacuation outcomes. Insights gained can inform better building designs, emergency training protocols, and evacuation strategies; ultimately enhancing preparedness and safety measures. Moreover, the expanded simulation capabilities offer opportunities for interdisciplinary research and collaboration across fields such as urban planning, disaster management, and human behavior studies. By continuously refining and expanding the simulation, we contribute to the development of more effective emergency response strategies and the mitigation of potential risks in diverse real-world scenarios. All before the building is even built and someone has the opportunity to get hurt.
